# Parallel Machine Learning
Implementation of a competition-based aggregation scheme for machine learning models trained on different nodes of distributed system. This approach allows black-box parallelisation and does not put any strict restraints on the algorithm. An empirical study shows that the suggested approach allows to reach comparable level of accuracy to the centralised learning while taking much less time due to parallelisation.
